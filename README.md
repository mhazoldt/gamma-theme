This is the theme I use with VS Code. It is a high contrast theme that has specific bracket colors for objects, classes, functions and arrow functions.

You can copy this directory into your .\vscode\extensions folder or you can install the VS Code theme/extension [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator and make a new theme and copy/paste the json from .\themes\gamma-theme-color-theme.json

Per the [documention](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) install the generator and yeoman with npm.

`npm install -g yo generator-code`

I also use a [terminal-button](https://github.com/mhazoldt/vs-code-terminal-button) that I think is convenient.
